# LTT-WPF-App-VS-ProjectTemplate
A Visual Studio Project Template file for my [LTT-WPF-Application](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/LTT-WPF-Application) template.

## Installing and Removing
I didn't make a VSIX installer and had my Visual Studio (VS) export the template so it was already where it needed to be when I wanted to use it. 

I believe **you** can just copy (or delete if you wanted to remove) the ZIP file in 3 places...

1. {Documents}\Visual Studio {Number}\My Exported Templates
2. {Documents}\Visual Studio {Number}\Templates\ProjectTemplates
3. {User}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio {Number}\ProjectTemplatesCache

This will add or remove the project template from VS for you. If VS was running you will need to restart it for the changes to take affect (I believe, not 100% sure).
