# LTT-WPF-App-VS-ProjectTemplate
A Visual Studio Project Template file for my [LTT-WPF-Application](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/LTT-WPF-Application) template.

## Installing and Removing
I didn't make a VSIX installer and had my Visual Studio (VS) export the template so it was already where it needed to be when I wanted to use it. 

I believe **you** can just copy (or delete if you wanted to remove) the ZIP file in 3 places...

1. {Documents}\Visual Studio {Number}\My Exported Templates
2. {Documents}\Visual Studio {Number}\Templates\ProjectTemplates
3. {User}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio {Number}\ProjectTemplatesCache

This will add or remove the project template from VS for you. If VS was running you will need to restart it for the changes to take affect (I believe, not 100% sure).

## What Is It
It is a project template for Visual Studio that will generate a complex WPF application base that is setup for MVVM development with a ServiceLocator pattern tied in. It has a built in logger, using my [SimpleRollingLogger](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/SimpleRollingLogger) API (NuGet package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleRollingLogger/)), has a built in translation mechanism using my [WPf.Translation](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/WPF.Translations) API (NuGet package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WPF.Translations/)) and has built in theming (light and dark mode). The theme work comes from my [WPF.Themes](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/WPF.Themes) repo, there is no NuGet package for that.

## What Do You Get
There is a lot in this project template so let's go over what is included...

We will just got from top to bottom as there is a bit to go over and all important.

- Language -> allows the user to change the language/culture currently set for the application.
